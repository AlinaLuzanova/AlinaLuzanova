### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Alina Luzanova
#### I'm a web-developer from Saint Petersburg, Russia

Came to ITMO University as a chemist, but under the influence of the environment became a developer. I develop interfaces, using the classic React + TypeScript stack. I like interesting and non-standard tasks, and I approach the solution of such tasks consistently. Constantly improving both in technical skills and in the field of management, communication and team management.


I am a co-founder, tech lead and sometimes developer in the Thothex project, which was born in ITMO on the basis of the Infochemistry Research Center. Together with the team we promote AI in chemistry, create products for science and education, and engage in outreach activities.  For me, Thothex is a field for technical experiments, the opportunity to lead a development team and grow a start-up from scratch.


Outside of development, I teach my dog commands, ride my bike, travel, practice Spanish, and sometimes read classics
